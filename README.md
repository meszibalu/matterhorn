# Matterhorn

Matterhorn is my hobby project, the goal is to upload my 4000ers climbs in
the Alps to Google Street View. My first climb what I uploaded there was the
climb of Matterhorn, one of the most beautiful mountains in the world.

If you are interested in how did I made it, check out this video:

Sometimes I will open-source the project, but till then happy arm-chair
climbing:
